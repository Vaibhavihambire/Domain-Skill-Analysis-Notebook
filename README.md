# Domain-Skill-Analysis-Notebook

## Project Overview
The **Domain Skills Analysis** project uses machine learning to forecast in-demand skills across various professional domains. By analyzing datasets from diverse sources, the project develops a predictive model that achieves high accuracy in identifying the skills necessary for different job roles. The results are presented in a visually intuitive format, making it easier for professionals to understand and act on the insights.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn
- **Data Analysis**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Development Environment**: Jupyter Notebook

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/domain-skills-analysis.git
   ```

2. Install Python 3.x from the [official website](https://www.python.org/).

3. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
   ```

4. Open the project in Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

5. Run the notebook file to load datasets, preprocess data, and train the machine learning model.

## Usage

- The notebook is structured to guide you through the steps of data loading, preprocessing, training the model, and visualizing results.
- Use the visual insights to understand domain-specific skill requirements and trends.
